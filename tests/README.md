# tests for stdinread

No actual tests here... However, you can perform a very simple
test running the bash script `test.sh`. It installs the module
in the current directory and runs `node cat.mjs`. The `cat`
script copies itself to the `/tmp` directory and compares the
two files.

To run the test, run the file with `./test.js`.
